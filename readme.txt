To run the program follow the below instructions:


(1) Command to run the program is : python q5.py < try.txt --n_items 7 --w_max 40 --iter 10000
(2) Here the program takes input from the file try.txt
(3) This file contains n_items lines entries. These represent the entries of the tables. 
(4) We can change the parameters n_items and w_max, correspondingly change the no of entries in the file try.txt
(5) The default iterations are 10000.
(6) The arguments --n_items and --w_max are required while --iter is not mandatory to give as command line input. 
(7) The output is Initial population with score of each sample along with it and the final population with each sample score.
(8) We also output the initial population score and the final population score.
